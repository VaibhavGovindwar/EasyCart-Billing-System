# EasyCart-Billing-System

## Project Overview:
The EasyCart Grocery Store application is a console-based tool designed to simulate a shopping experience.  You can enter items by entering product codes '@01, @02,----', specify the desired quantity, and receive an automatically generated bill. The application manages inventory in real time by updating a CSV file, ensuring the storeâ€™s stock is always up-to-date. It also generates detailed bills that include discounts, itemized purchases, and total quantities.

## Features:

1. Real-time Inventory Management: Automatically updates product quantities in the CSV file after each transaction.
2. CSV Data Integration: The application reads and writes data to a CSV file that stores product details like product codes, names, prices, and quantities.
3. Billing System: This system generates a detailed bill, calculates total quantities and prices, and applies a discount to the final amount.
4. Out-of-Stock Notification: Notifies users when an item is out of stock and shows available quantities for each product.
5. Sample Output: A console-based bill summary that displays the purchased items, total quantities, prices, and discounts.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VaibhavGovindwar/EasyCart-Billing-System.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd EasyCart-Billing-System
   ```

3. Install the required dependency:
   ```bash
   pip install prettytable
   ```
   ```bash
   pip install csv
   ```
4. Add the Inventory CSV: Ensure the Grocery_list.csv file (formatted as shown below) is present in the project directory.
   
5. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python EasyCart-Billing-System.py
   ```
   
## Sample Dataset (CSV): The Grocery_list.csv file should contain the following format:
```
Product_Code,Product_Name,Price,Quantity
@01,Ariel Detergent,110.0,30
@02,Ariel Liquid,150.0,35
@03,Body Lotion,99.0,40
@04,Bread,49.0,40
@05,Coco-Cola,25.0,28
```
- This file serves as the inventory data, which gets updated dynamically as products are purchased.
- You can customize the dataset according to your requirements of product or you can update the inventory products 

## Sample output:
